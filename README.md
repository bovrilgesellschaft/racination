# Racination

A household-management game of devotion, discipline and the Pit, 1983–1989.
Adults only (18+).

Current build: **Milestone 2, residents.** Eight women with faces, figures,
wardrobes, meters and duties on the rota, on top of Milestone 1's weekly turn,
ledger and saving. Each resident's page has a portrait description to copy
into an image generator.

## How to play it

1. On this repository's GitHub page, click the green **Code** button, then **Download ZIP**.
2. Unzip the download. You get a folder called `racination-main`.
3. Open that folder and double-click `index.html`. It opens in your web browser.

Nothing needs installing and the game needs no internet connection once downloaded.
Keep all the files together in their folders, or the game can't find them.

## Saving

- The game saves itself in your browser at every step.
- **Save file** downloads your game as a small file. **Load file** reads one back.
  Use these to move a game between computers, or to keep a copy.
- Some browsers (Safari, and most iPhones) don't always keep games saved
  from a file on your disk. If Continue doesn't appear when you come back,
  use Save file before closing.

## Editing the words and figures

Everything in the `data` folder is for editing:

- `data/house.js`: starting money, weekly accounts, the Housekeeper's lines.
- `data/appearance.js`: the appearance lists (from the spreadsheet), hair
  styles, make-up, expressions and the sentences descriptions are built from.
- `data/wardrobe.js`: the 1930s and modern garments.
- `data/residents.js`: names, backgrounds, duties, desires, ties, secrets,
  the weekly drift of the meters, and the household's lines.

Each file opens in any text editor (TextEdit on a Mac:
choose Format → Make Plain Text; Notepad on Windows). Change the words
between quotation marks and the numbers; leave the rest alone. If the game
shows an error after an edit, look for a missing comma or quotation mark.

## Testing tools

On the title screen, **Testing tools** switches on extra buttons: nudging a
resident's meters, showing her secret, and making a new household. They are
for checking the game and will be removed before release.
